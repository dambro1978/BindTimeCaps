These libraries allow you to make asynchronous calls to any service or api or rpc, c#, php, java etc...
storing the result also in an asynchronous variable.
Indeed a time capsule.
Ideal for use with jquery controls, or others,
It can be an alternative to Angular or for binding to ReactJS, SignalR etc.
